                        <h3>Idea</h3>
                        <p>a poster for a movie called One Tenth.
                            My goal was to convey a sense of what the movie could be to
                            the audience.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Plan</h3>
                        <p>I wanted to show a rivalry between two
                            champions at their peak in the F1 championship.
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to convey this, it was important to place the two
                            characters at the same Hight, allowing them to feel equal in
                            strength, I felt that I also needed them to be in similar poses
                        </p>

                        <h3>Typography</h3>
                        <p>For the title, the o is symbolized by an F1 tire, to create a metaphor in
                            the title, allowing for a more general audience to feel a
                            connection. The font is inspired by other racing movie titles like Fast and Furious, Need for Speed, and
                        Hotwheels.
                        I placed the T’s in the title close to the adjacent letters to add a unique style to the
                        title.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Colour</h3>
                        <p>
                            The colour scheme I use is a wide range of
                            colour’s, I want the poster to feel “realistic”, conveying that
                            the movie is closely related to real life.</p>

                    <h3>Idea</h3>
                    <p>A vector portrait of a
                        a beutifull black woman because I find a lack
                        of inclusion when it comes to the
                        digital art community, including in my
                        own work.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Proccess</h3>
                    <p>I first used a very dark gray to
                        outline important features. Then I
                        added shades of gray on their own
                        separate layers to create shadow
                        and depth. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Colour</h3>
                    <p>
                       Once the piece was done
                        in gray scale I added colour that is
                        high contrast to make the portrait
                        unique and pop out.

                    <h3>Idea</h3>
                    <p>Inspired by my father sleeping
                        on the couch with his work
                        computer on his lap. I wanted
                        to comment on the negative
                        impact that covid- 19 and
                        working from home has had on people.
                        When working from home,
                        there is no physical separation
                        of work and private life. This
                        leads to people feeling
                        overworked - they cannot
                        escape their job, and always
                        think about their work.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Proccess</h3>
                    <p>
                        for the background patterns I used bowls that i found in my kitchen, 
                        then changing the gradient map of each respective image to a bright colour with a black background.
                        Then I used 3 images that convey my idea well as the focal point, each image has there 
                        gradient map to a red and blue hue making it look psycidelic. for the finishing touch, 
                        A withered chalkboard teaxture was added making the graphic feel more realistic.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Colour</h3>
                    <p>
                        The colour pallete is inspired by brutulist style posters where its usally a combination of black and a bright colour.
                        I also wanted to include other colours to the background to not make it feel flat and boring. Then as contrast, The images 
                        that are placed ontop do not have any black and are mostly just bright red and blue, this allows for them to pop out, further
                        allowing them to be the focal point of the Graphic poster.
